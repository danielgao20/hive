# LavaLab Spring 2024 Challenge App üöÄ

Hey there! This is my build of the LavaLab Spring 2024 Developer Challenge.

## Features

- **Quick Profile Dropdown**: Ever wanted to see your name (my name) in a dropdown? Just click your profile pic!
- **Dark/Light Mode Magic**: Toggle between two NavBar themes with a flick of a switch!
- **Friendly Buttons**: 'Back' and 'Finish' buttons that don't just sit there ‚Äî they talk back with a message!

## Built With ‚ù§Ô∏è and:

- **React**: For all those reusable components that make life easier.
- **TailwindCSS**: Because who has time to write custom CSS when you've got Tailwind?
